**Arctic Keys** is a virtual analog synthesizer. With a classic dual-oscillator subtractive synthesis design that give you the sound creation flexibility we all know and love. The easy to use user interface just wants to be tweaked. The result is a truly professional instrument with an audio quality that rivals that of hardware synthesizers

## Tweak
With all the synthesizer parameters immediately available on one page, you get instant feedback as you tweak.

The two LFOs each have three modulation destinations. Each LFO may also be free running or sync'ed to tempo and the timing rate adjusted.

The modulation matrix allows for deep routing between the Mod Wheel, aftertouch and 16 x 4 analog-style gated step-sequencer.

## Perform
The classic arpeggiator is complimented by the 16 x 4 gated step-sequencer. Play a note to trigger the sequencer.

Step through a sequence to play short melodic lines or let it modulate the synthesiser. Each of the 4 tracks have an assignable modulation destination and loop point.

Adjust the velocity by tapping along the length of the key from top to bottom. Change the key mode to mono for retro lead lines.

## Share
The live phrase recorder lets you save your performances as 44.1KHz 16-bit WAV files and as a Standard MIDI File. Upload the WAV file to SoundCloud.

The recorded MIDI File includes all the knob's control change information along with the notes you play.

Use Sonoma AudioCopy or Intua Audio Sharing to paste recorded audio directly into other apps.

E-mail the patches you make or share them over Wi-Fi.
