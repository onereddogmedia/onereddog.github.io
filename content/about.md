I am a software developer who likes synthesizers, electronic music, and software security. Some of which I do as part of my day job.  

Over the years I've written and released some music apps for iOS, along with many other things. The marketing materials for these apps are here on this site. The majority are now legacy and no longer available on the App Store.  

These days, I mostly write about things that I'm either doing, or that interest me. This covers a wide range of topics from software dev through to (offensive) security.
