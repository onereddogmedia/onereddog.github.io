# Github Pages Website

This is the repository for my static website hosted at https://www.onereddog.com.au.

The website is generated using Hugo and hosted on Github Pages. The 'main' branch contains the source materials (markdown files in the `content` directory) and configuration
for Hugo to generate a static website.
